		This daily horoscope calendar made specially for you is based on your personal transits. 
		It shows the planetary influences on your everyday life for one year (or one month, if you decide on the short version). 
		Here you can read about the astrological influences affecting a couple of days or just a few hours of your life. <br />
		Some days simply seem to be bad days - nothing works out, while on other days everything seems to be going your way. 
		There are days when one feels sad and depressed, seemingly without reason. 
		There are days when one longs for human contact and days when one just wants to hide ...

		Certainly, the underlying mood of any longer period of your life can be inferred from the transits of the slow moving planets - 
		their effects are often noticeable for several months or even years. 
		But just as it would be boring to read the same important news in the paper every day, 
		it would also be wrong to concentrate exclusively on the long lasting transits. 
		Everyday matters are just as important to our daily lives as are the long ranging tendencies.
