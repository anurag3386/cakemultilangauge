$this->IntroductionParagraph
(
 "This horoscope is your personal cosmic fingerprint. ".
 "No other person will have exactly the same combination of influences, ".
 "unless they were born in the same second and exactly the same place as you were. ".
 "With 10 planets, 12 signs of the zodiac and 12 houses there are approximately 1500 simple combinations in the horoscope, ".
 "and when you add to that the different degrees and combinations between planets ".
 "there are tens of thousands of influences which have to be weighed and juggled in any astrological interpretation. ".
 "No computer programme can do this satisfactorily, but we do our best."

$this->IntroductionParagraph
(
 "Reports from Astrology Enterprises Limited are designed to simplify the interpretation process for you. ".
 "It indicates for example the relative strengths of different planetary influences so you can see what is most important. ".
 "Furthermore this written report is divided up into sections on Identity, Emotions, Mentality, Love and Sexuality ".
 "to eliminate apparent contradictions which arise in the character description. ".
 "But the reader must bear in mind that contradictions will arise. ".
 "People are complex and contain many contradictory traits. ".
 "Diametrically opposed character descriptions will either reflect inner dilemmas or outer conflicts reflected in the behaviour of others."

$this->IntroductionParagraph
(
 "The Astrology Enterprises Limited birth report can cover your personal character, ".
 "your professional life or a combination of both, ".
 "depending on your choice of report. ".
 "The professional section addresses the questions: ".
 "\"What talents do I have?\" and \"How can I use this ability?\" ".
 "The personal section is concerned with relationships and hidden psychological causes, ".
 "and addresses the question: \"How can I improve myself in this area?\""
 );

$this->IntroductionHeader( 'PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE' );
$this->IntroductionParagraph
(
 "Our reports can also integrate trends of the next year or two into the birth analysis, ".
 "going beyond a static description of personal character ".
 "and introducing a dynamic sense of what is happening for you here and now. ".
 "The dynamic trends show the unfoldment of the horoscope through time. ".
 "By analysing the current trends, it is therefore possible for you to gain insight into events just past, ".
 "events happening at the present moment and trends into the future."

		"You may notice contradictions in your report; these reflect your complex personality. ".
		"For instance, you may be a wallflower in certain situations, but other circumstances might ".
		"bring out your chatty side. While your chart may provide helpful insights, it cannot predict the future. ".
		"You are ultimately the master of your own fate."
