<p>I have practiced as an astrologer for 12 years. I find that giving the client a time perspective as regards how long a certain period is going to last, as well as providing understanding of specific astrological influences is perhaps the most helpful and supportive perspective astrology can provide. The life theme that lies in an individual’s chart is triggered by the transits and progressions throughout a lifetime, and to have a guide by your side who knows exactly where you are, and how you feel or think through that period, can be a very supportive and relieving experience.</p><br />
<p>My approach to astrology is a psychological and therapeutic one; that doesn’t mean that I am analyzing you, that means that my finest goal is to meet you with understanding, acceptance and compassion exactly where you are in life, and that our meeting is a cooperation to focus on the resources or challenges that are most present for you. I use therapeutic communication methods to make it a more authentic and helpful experience for you, but my basic understanding is based upon your birth chart and its current influences. Some clients choose to continue in therapy with me if they are in a period where they feel that’s necessary for them; others are fine with a single session. </p><br />
<p>I have a 4-year training from Psychotherapeutic Institute in Copenhagen which is a practical therapeutic training and I am currently studying psychology at Aalborg university. I continue to be amazed by the individual’s chart and the many nuances that are to be found in it. Using this chart we can develop an optimal way to give understanding and support – especially through periods of crisis and transformation.</p>';
