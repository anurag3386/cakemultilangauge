KeyAtlas.txt
TimeTabs.txt
makedb.pl
timedb.pl
city.html
lookup.cgi
county.cgi
lutime.cgi
Atlas.howto

When everything is installed and working, you will have an html file and a set of scripts
that enable your web site to accept a city and state or country and birth date and time, and
look up the city latitude and longitude, and the time zone and type.  The result is written
to a birthdata file for use by other programs or scripts.  The files as supplied also ask
for an e-mail address, and use that to create a customer directory in which the birthdata
file is placed, and where the programs using the birthdata can place their output.

General directions:

Run the Perl scripts to convert the text files to database files.
Move the files to the appropriate directories.
Change the directory definition statements in the lookup scripts.
Put the scripts in cgi-bin and the city.html file wherever your users are directed.

Specific directions:

You need the Fcntl and DB_File Perl modules installed.
Run makedb.pl to build a database file called atlas.db from KeyAtlas.txt.
Run timedb.pl to build a database file called timetabs.db from TimeTabs.txt.
Move atlas.db to whatever directory you want it to be in.
Edit lookup.cgi and change the $AtlasDB statement to point to the atlas.db directory.
Change the action= statements to point to lutime.cgi and county.cgi in your cgi-bin directory.
Edit county.cgi and change the action= statement to point to lutime.cgi in your cgi-bin directory.
Move timetabs.db to whatever directory you want it to be in.
Edit lutime.cgi and change the $TimeDB statement to point to the timetabs.db directory.
Change the $BaseDir statement in lutime.cgi to point to your base report directory, unless
you are not using an intermediate birthdata file, in which case you are changing the
scripts extensively anyway, and presumably know what you are doing.
Add statements to the end of lutime.cgi to do whatever you are going to do with the birthdata.
Move or copy lookup.cgi, lutime.cgi, and county.cgi to your cgi-bin directory.
Move or copy city.html to wherever you want it to be in your html structure.

How it all works:

The city.html file invokes the lookup.cgi script, which finds all cities matching the
canonical form of the city entered by the user, in the state or country selected.  Note that
the two letter codes for the states and countries are arbitrary, chosen to get the state/
country list in alphabetical order, and do not conform to any accepted standards.
If only one city matches, lookup.cgi generates an html form which asks for the birth date
and time.  That form then invokes lutime.cgi, which looks up the time zone and type and
writes the birthdata file.
If more than one city matches, lookup.cgi generates an html form which asks the user to select
the correct one.  That form invokes county.cgi, which generates an html form asking for the
birth data and time, which again invokes lutime.cgi.

Using the data:

The Atlas text file is in the iso-8859-1 character set.

The latitude and longitude are in seconds of arc:
degrees times 3600 plus minutes times 60 plus seconds.
Positive values of longitude are West of Greenwich, negative values are East.
Positive values of latitude are North of the equator, negative values are South.

The time zone is the hours from Greenwich of the zone times 900.
This allows zones that have fractional hours to be represented as integers.
For example, US Eastern Time is 4500 (5 times 900).  India time is -4950 (-5.5 times 900).
Zones west of Greenwich are positive, east of Greenwich are negative.

The time type value is:
0 Standard Time
1 Daylight Savings Time (subtract 1 hour for Standard)
2 War Time (subtract 1 hour for Standard)
3 Double Summer Time (subtract 2 hours for Standard)
4 Local Mean Time (hours from Greenwich is longitude in degrees divided by 15)
