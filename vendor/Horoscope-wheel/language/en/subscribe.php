		These terms apply to customers who purchase a subscription to one of Astrowow’s astrology products, and the agreement is made between Astrowow ApS and the subscriber.<br /><br />
		<b class="txt-purple">Subscribing</b><br />
		The subscription process is described on <a href=\'http://www.astrowow.com\'>www.astrowow.com</a> and a subscription agreement becomes valid after the subscriber has received order confirmation by email.<br />
		You will receive email confirmation when each subscription payment is deducted from your account.<br /><br />
		
		<b class="txt-purple">Order confirmation</b><br />
		Astrowow will send an order confirmation my email when you have applied for a subscription. The subscription begins when this email has been received.<br />
		Prior to completing of the sale, Astrowow will send a reminder to you about the product, the price and the date at which payment is deducted.<br />
		The reminder will be sent 7 days before payment is due. You are entitled to inform Astrowow if you do not want the relevant astrology product at this time, at which point the order will be cancelled.<br /><br />
		
		<b class="txt-purple">Payment</b><br />
		Payment for the subscription takes place either via your credit card or PayPal. You should therefore choose which payment solution you require prior to ordering: credit card, where you supply your card information and Astrowow subsequently deducts payment directly from your account, or by using your PayPal account.<br />
		Astrowow will send an email 7 days before payment is due reminding you about payment. You can at any time up to the due date for payment cancel your subscription.<br /><br />
				
		<b class="txt-purple">Credit Card payment</b><br />
		If you have chosen credit card payment, through acceptance of these subscription terms you hereby give permission for Astrowow to debit your account.<br />
		Astrowow will debit your account 3 bank days prior to the subscription being available to the subscriber.
		You can use either MasterCard or Visa. Your card information will be encrypted and sent directly to NETS through a secure SSL connection. Please note that your account may be debited before the astrology product becomes available. 
		For Astrowow to be able to deduct payment from your account, you need to supply the card information connected with your account. A precondition for Astrowow to be able to deduct payment from your account is that there are sufficient funds in your account.<br />
		If Astrowow cannot proceed with payment, for example because the card has been blocked or has expired, or because of insufficient funds, then Astrowow will consider the subscription cancelled.<br /><br />
		
		<b class="txt-purple">Prices</b><br />
		For EU customers there is a surcharge of 25% Danish VAT. Sale of astrology products outside EU will not have the added surcharge. The price of each subscription will be displayed based on the prices shown in Astrowow’s webshop.<br /><br />
		
		<b class="txt-purple">Cancellation</b><br />
		The subscription continues until one of the parties cancels. Cancellation can take place via email or online. You can cancel your subscription at any time.<br />
		Subscriptions to Astrowow’s astrology products are subject to EU law.<br />
		After cancellation of a subscription, all relevant payment information is deleted from Astrowow<br />.
		You have the right to regret a subscription for a period of 14 days, whereupon your payment will be refunded without charge.<br /><br />
				
		<b class="txt-purple">Registration of information</b><br />
		When you establish a subscription with Astrowow, all the information you supply will be registered - name, card information, address and email – in our order database. This information is used to process your order and for internal statistics. Individual Astrowow employees have access to this data. The data is kept for a period of 5 years. No personal information will be given to a third party. An SSL certificate is used for transmission of data.<br /><br />
		
		<b class="txt-purple">Changing Credit Card information</b><br />
		If your card information is not correct, for example because you have received a new card, and this prevents payment from taking place, then the order in question will be cancelled. To change the credit card details you need to cancel your subscription and make a new one.<br /><br />
