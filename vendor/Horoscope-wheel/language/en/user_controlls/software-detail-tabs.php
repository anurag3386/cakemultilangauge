$_['ASTROLOGY_FOR_LOVERS_FAQs'] 	= '<b class="txt-purple">Copying Data from Horoscope Interpreter to Astrology for Lovers...?</b><br />
	The Data directories from the new 32 bit versions of our programs are unfortunately not compatible. <br /><br />
	<b class="txt-purple">Interpretation Window not visible...?</b><br />

	<b class="txt-purple">How does the Time Unknown function work...?</b><br />
	This function is designed to make horoscopes as accurate as possible, when the birth time is unknown. Zero degrees of the Sun Sign is placed on the Ascendant, the horoscope is calculated for Noon, and planets are displayed in solar, equal houses. <br /> <br />';

$_['ASTROLOGY_HI_FAQs'] 	= '<b class="txt-purple">Dynamic Analysis stops at 2006...?</b><br /> 
		You can make a transit analysis for any period from 1500 to 2099. Click onOptions, then Dynamic Analysis. At the top you will see the period of years to analyze. Simply write any other 1 to 3 year period in this box - and off you go. <br /> <br /> 
		<b class="txt-purple">How do I backup my Data...?</b><br /> 
		Whenever you reinstall the program you should copy important files to a safe place. When you add names and birthdata they are stored in files in the DATA directory beginning with "Name". These files are: <br /> Name.db, Name.mb, Name.px, Namegrps.db, Namegrps.xg0, Namegrps.yg0<br /> <br /> 
		If you have also added new towns, adjusted Time Zones or Summer Times, then these are stored in the DATA directory in the following files: <br /> 
		Places.db, Places.px, summer.db, summer.px, zone.db, zone.px, zoneid.db, zoneid.px, zoneid.xg0 <br /> 
		We recommend you store the whole DATA directory on your hard disk if you have sufficient space. <br /> <br />
		<b class="txt-purple">No MC position with Equal House system...?</b><br />
		It`s true that WOW programs do not cater for the Equal House system. This is because the Interpretation facilities would not work with the MC and 10th house cusp being in different places. You can calculate the horoscope in Placidus and write the MC/IC positions in manually if you wish. <br /> <br /> 
		<b class="txt-purple">Font Problem: Strange symbols appear on the Horoscope...?</b><br /> 
		When the planet symbols don`t appear on the horoscope wheel, you`ve got font problems! This is actually no fault of the World of Wisdom program, and is to do with the fact that there are many fonts on the machine and our fonts have either been "pushed out" or simply couldn`t be installed. <br /> <br />
		It`s quite simple to manually install WOW fonts.<br /> 
		1. Fonts need to be installed from the CD or shareware so you should locate them on the WOW folder.<br /> 
		2. Open up the Fonts window from Control Panel. Make sure the two WOW fonts are not in it. If they are, remove them by right-clicking on the fonts, then on Properties, then on Delete.<br />
		3. Choose File, on the menu bar, then Install New Font...<br /> 
		4. The ADD FONTS window opens.<br /> 
		5. Find the two WOW fonts in the TEMP directory.<br /> 
		6. When they appear in the font window, click on them both and click OK<br /> 
		7. The fonts will now be installed in WINDOWS/SYSTEM/FONTS.<br /> 
		Restart WOW and you should be in business. <br /> <br />

		<b class="txt-purple">A.M. and P.M. times...?</b><br /> 
		World of Wisdom programs use the 24-hour clock, not the a.m./p.m. system. Morning births are the same as a.m. but if you are born in the afternoon, you`ll need to add 12 hours to the p.m. time. For example: <br /> 3.20 p.m. = 15.20, or 11.30 p.m. = 23.30 <br /> <br />';
