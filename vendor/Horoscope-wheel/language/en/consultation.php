                                With the advent of Skype it is possible to really offer an astrological service that is worthwhile, especially if the client has a web cam which helps capture a lot of nuances in the consultation. You can order a consultation at the bottom of the page. The waiting time is approximately two weeks. I will contact you via email after you have made your payment.
