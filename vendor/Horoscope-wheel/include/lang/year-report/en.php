Materially you struggle to find the key to security and survival. But above all this is the time to share what you know and seek out people who can enhance your knowledge so that you can enlighten others about the way you see the world.

Confrontation with established authorities may be a characteristic of this time, and as a counterweight you will seek strong alliances with people and groups who support your efforts and views.

You may cast about for something new to bring vitality and inspiration, but there will be many false starts. Still, the seed of a new future is discovered at this time, though it is early days.
