$_['ARIS_CHARACTERISTICS'] = "Physically it is related to the head. It is said to have a masculine nature, and is therefore more penetrative in its energy.<br /><br />
Aries is a Fire sign, and this means a planet placed here will have a need to manifest itself in a very dynamic manner, and that the expression of personal identity through action is important. The desire to come first is paramount, and this comes to expression with a naive effervescence and inexperienced innocence. It is a world of knights and princesses.<br /><br />
As Aries is also a Cardinal sign, its energy is manifested in dynamic bursts. Short-term goals are important and tangible results are achieved rapidly. People with a strong emphasis in this sign will have leadership and pioneer traits, though there is a tendency to impulsiveness and a short temper. Impatience and egocentricity need to be tempered, and greater awareness of the needs of others should be developed, if conflict and tension are to be avoided.";

Taurus is an Earth sign and as such is connected with fruitfulness and stability. A planet placed in this sign will be a stabilising influence and manifest its energy in a steadfast and determined manner. Taurus is also a Fixed sign, and this means that once a course is embarked on, it is rarely deviated from. Maintenance and care of existing conditions over long periods of time, and a reluctance to initiate change, are qualities of this sign.<br /><br />
Taurus is also connected with the resources of Nature, and the whole issue of value and worth. Therefore it is associated with finance, worldly goods and security. People with a strong emphasis in this sign tend to be materialistic, and often get stuck in a rut. By periodically cutting their strong attachments they can gain greater perspective. There is a talent for relaxation and enjoyment of sensory pleasures.";

Planets placed in this sign will often reflect on personal intelligence, bringing a tremendous curiosity and a need to exchange ideas with other people in a social environment. Negative manifestations of Gemini influences are a flightiness and unreliability, and a tendency to get involved with too many things at any one time. There is a love of ideas, but no inner need to put them into practice.<br /><br />
Nevertheless this influence confers great mental insight, though there is often some kind of split in connection with planets placed in this sign. Planets here manifest considerable versatility and mental skills in regard to all forms of communication";

It is a Water sign, and as such is connected to the world of emotion and the instincts. It is also a Cardinal sign, which means that planets placed here will express themselves in a very dynamic fashion - especially in matters connected with care and protection. This sign is associated with motherhood and the family. There is a great sensitivity on an inner level, but rather a secretive nature. Loyalty and attachment, sentimentality and hanging on to the past, are all characteristics associated with Cancer.<br /><br />
Planets in this sign will often reflect a vulnerable character and oversensitive nature. There is also a possessive streak, and a tendency to be emotionally smothering. Nevertheless Cancer confers a strong intuitive nature and deeply-held feelings. There is a strong attachment to the home and awareness of the environment.

As a Water sign it is connected with the world of emotions, particular the deep primeval emotions concerned with sexuality and survival. As a Fixed sign, its energy manifests in a stable manner, giving great determination and endurance. Planets in Scorpio seek to establish emotional security in a threatening world. Hence the association with jealousy and passion.<br /><br />
Anxiety in the face of the unknown and consequently a desire to be able to control what is going on leads to a certain obsessive quality in planets placed in this sign. There is a secretiveness and compulsiveness which is hidden under a facade of strong self-control.

As a Fire sign it is connected with the identity - specifically with the search to find a deeper meaning in human existence. It is therefore connected with religious and philosophical urges. As a Mutable sign, planets placed here express their energy in a flexible and changeable manner, with a certain restlessness or inconstancy. Sagittarius in characterised by a love of truth and righteousness, and an unfortunate tendency to express it rather too directly, even when not asked.<br /><br />
There is a love of open horizons and travel and a need to expand on an inner intellectual level. There is a pronounced urge to rise above the animal nature towards the divine, and an impatience with the trivial issues in life.

Planets in this sign express themselves in a unique and unconventional manner. This can lead to an experience of alienation or social isolation. Nevertheless the energy of Aquarius is in essence friendly and expresses itself in social relationships where shared ideals play a greater role than emotions.
